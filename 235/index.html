    <p>I'm a second year Game Design and Development major. In my free time I like to play video games, and recently I got into balisong flipping. I also listen to a lot of music; my top artists are Travis Scott, Don Toliver, and Ye</p>
    <p>From this class I want to become proficient in all levels of web development so I have the ability to pursue full-stack development roles as a backup after I graduate. 
         After I graduate I want to either pursue a masters in computer science or get a job in software development.</p>
